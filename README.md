# Empowered Pathways

The purpose of this mod is to provide fun path-creation tools. It is intended to be simplistic to use and fun to play with.
Overall we are currently in the beginning stages of creating this mod.

# Features

This mod features blocks that were in an old mod created by @Negative_light called Stoneworks or Compressed stone.
This code was not expandable nor was it easy to work with therefore he created this new mod called Empowered-Pathways.

## Blocks

### Stonework
All blocks extend from the stonework block which is crafted with 9 Stone.

### Infused Blocks
Infused blocks emit a slight glow thanks to glow lichen.

### Reinforced Blocks
Reinforced Blocks are more blast-resistant and are crafted by combining the base block with Iron

## Paths

All the blocks have a "path" variant crafted using the **grader**. 
The grader block is crafted like any iron tool and works kinda like a hoe, shovel, and pickaxe all in one.
Right-click any empowered pathways block to create a new path block that increases player walk speed and includes special features.
