## Paths

All the blocks have a "path" variant crafted using the **grader**. 
The grader block is crafted like any iron tool and works kinda like a hoe, shovel and a pickaxe all in one.
Rightclick any empowered pathways block to create a new path block that increases player walk speed and includes special features.
